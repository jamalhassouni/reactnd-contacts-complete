## Contacts Project
This repo is a code-along with the first project in the [React Nanodegree program.](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

This project was created in the classroom by React
Allows you to add and delete contacts based on the API
I applied what I learned in the classroom and I set up this small project, we used most of the things known in the React and also used the library React-router-dom to facilitate the movement between the pages

### Project Setup
1. Clone the Project - `git clone https://github.com/jamalhassouni/reactnd-contacts-complete.git`
2. Go into the directory where the project now lives - `cd reactnd-contacts-complete`
3. Install the dependencies - `npm install`

5. you need also to run this contacts server from here [reactnd-contacts-server.](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-contacts-server).
